# install.conf.yaml
# This example is based on my install.conf.yaml at the time of the writing:
# https://github.com/natikgadzhi/dotfiles/blob/main/install.conf.yaml
#
# Here's the dotbot config guide: https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot#configuration
 
# By default, create, relink, and rewrite each config file defined in this config.
- defaults:
    link:
      create: true
      relink: true
      force: true
 
# clean will prune any dead symlinks to any of the listed file paths below in the directory.
- clean: ["~"]
 
# links specify which configuration files from the dotfiles repository to
# link on a target system, and where they should be located on
# the target system, and in the repo.
- link:
    ~/.gitconfig:
      path: .gitconfig
    # Take all of the files and directories in .config dir of this repo,
    # and link them to the target system
    # at ~/.config.
    ~/.config/:
      glob: true
      path: .config/*
    ~/.ansible.cfg:
      path: .ansible.cfg
    # This is the neat part: dotbot configuration manages Mackup configuration.
    ~/.mackup.cfg:
      path: .mackup.cfg

- create:
    - ~/.vim/undo-history 

# If you want to run any commands right after the dotfiles setup is complete,
# you can do that here.
# For example:
# - chsh -s $(which fish) to setup your shell, assuming fish is installed.
# - vim +'PlugInstall --sync' +qa to istall vim plugins, assuming you use vim-plug to manage them.
- shell: [git submodule update --init --recursive, Installing submodules]
